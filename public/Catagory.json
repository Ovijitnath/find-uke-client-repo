Because it is so small, it is perfect for traveling.Sometimes people with larger fingers or hands have trouble playing the soprano ukulele because the frets are closer together. "

It’s commonly tuned in standard tuning like the soprano uke although some people will opt to tune their g-string down an octave to low G tuning, also known as linear tuning."

For performers, the tenor ukulele is ideal because you get a rich full sound, and since you have more frets, you’re able to reach higher notes on the fretboard."
